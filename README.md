# BioPolyMech

BioPolyMech is a Python project currently under development, designed to analyze and visualize data related to the mechanical properties of bioplastics. 
These data are obtained using an Instron dynamometer and exported in CSV format. 
The project aims to simplify the process of extracting, filtering, and visualizing data for research and development purposes.

### 1. Data Extraction and Filtering
- Automatic import of data from CSV files generated by the Instron instrument.
- Addition of timestamp and filename to the data for better cataloging and traceability.
- Filtering of raw data to remove outliers or irrelevant values.

### 2. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- An intuitive GUI that allows users to select the folder containing the generated CSV files.
- The GUI will offer various options for data visualization and easy navigation between imported files.

### 3. Data Visualization and Plotting
- Multiple plotting modes to meet the specific needs of users.
- Features like zoom, panning, and saving visualizations.
- Ability to overlay multiple datasets for direct comparison.
